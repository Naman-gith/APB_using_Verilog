This project demonstrates a simple APB3 slave design in SystemVerilog with a single 32-bit register at address 0x00. The RTL is fully synthesizable and compatible with the APB protocol, implementing basic SETUP and ACCESS phases with PREADY always asserted for single-cycle transfers. A self-checking testbench is included to verify read and write operations, making it a useful reference for learning APB basics and building more complex bus-based designs.
